# Zone task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Run with `npm start`.

TODO:
* Fix 2 vs 4 spaces
* Tests
* Get image paths from TMDB configuration endpoint.
* Make it look nicer

Notes:
Filterable by rating is a little ambigiuous as the movies don't have a rating property.

Should we sort by `vote_average` or `popularity`.

Configuration API, not mentioned in the docs
